/*
 * TAXICAB NUMBERS
 * A taxicab number is an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two
 * cubes of integers in two different ways: a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3. For
 * example, 1729 = 9^3 + 10^3 = 1^3 + 12^3. Design an algorithm to find
 * all taxicab numbers with a, b, c, and d less than n.
 *
 * Version 1: Use time proportional to n^2 log n and space proportional to n^2.
 * Version 2: Use time proportional to n^2 log n and space proportional to n.
