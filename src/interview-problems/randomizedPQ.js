/*
 * RANDOMIZED PRIORITY QUEUE
 * Describe how to add the methods sample() and delRandom() to our binary
 * heap implementation. The two methods return a key that is chosen
 * uniformly at random among the remaining keys, with the latter method
 * also removing that key. The sample() method should take constant time;
 * the delRandom() method should take logarithmic time.
