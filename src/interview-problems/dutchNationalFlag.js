 * Given an array of n buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble,
 * sort them by color. The allowed operations are:
 *   - swap(i, j): swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j
 *   - color(i): color of pebble in bucket i
 *
 * The performance requirements are as follows:
 *   - At most n calls to color()
 *   - At most n calls to swap()
 *   - Constant extra space
