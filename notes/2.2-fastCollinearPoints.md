 *
 * FAST COLLINEAR POINTS
 *
 * It is possible to solve the problem much faster than the brute-force
 * solution. Given a point p, the following method determines whether p
 * participates in a set of 4 or more collinear points.
 *   - Think of p as the origin
 *   - For each other point q, determine the slope it makes with p
 *   - Sort the points according to the slopes they make with p
 *   - Check if any 3 (or more) adjacent points in the sorted order have equal
 *     slopes with respect to p. If so, these points, together with p, are
 *     collinear.
 *
 * Applying this method for each of the n points in turn yields an efficient
 * algorithm to the problem. The algorithm solves the problem because points
 * that have equal slopes with respect to p are collinear, and sorting brings
 * such points together. The algorithm is fast because the bottleneck operation
 * is sorting.
 *
 * Write a program FastCollinearPoints that implements this algorithm:
 *
 * class FastCollinearPoints {
 *   fast(points)         // finds all the line segments containing 4+ points
 *   numberOfSegments()   // number of line segments
 *   printLineSegments()  // prints all the line segments
 * }
 *
 * The method segments() should include each maximal line segment containing 4
 * (or more) points exactly once. For example, if 5 points appear on a line
 * segment in the order p->q->r->s->t, then do not include the subsegments p->s
 * or q->t.
 *
 * Performance requirements: the growth of the running time of your program
 * should be n^2 log n in the worst case and it should use space proportional
 * to n plus the number of line segments returned. FastCollinearPoints should
 * work properly even if the input has 5 or more collinear points.
