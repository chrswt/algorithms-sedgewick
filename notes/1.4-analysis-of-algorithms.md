### Mathematical Models
We often use **tilde notation** (~) which allows us to work with *tilde approximations*. These approximations allow us to throw away low-order terms that compilate formulas and represent a negligible contribution to values of interest:
> We write *~f(N)* to represent any function that, when divided by *f(N)*, approaches 1 as *N* grows, and we write *g(N) ~ f(N)* to indicate that *g(N) / f(N)* approaches 1 as *N* grows.

Power law: a straight line in a log-log plot is equivalent to the hypothesis that the data fits the equation *T(N) = a * N^b*

Useful approximations for the analysis of algorithms:  

| Description              | Approximation                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Harmonic Sum             | H_N = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/N ~ ln N       |
| Triangular Sum           | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + N ~ N^2 / 2                  |
| Geometric Sum            | 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + N = 2N - 1 ~ 2N when N = 2^n |
| Stirling's Approximation | lg N! = lg1 + lg2 + lg3 + lg4 + ... + lgN ~ N lgN  |
| Binomial Coefficients    | nCk ~ N^k / k! when k is a small constant          |
| Exponential              | (1 - 1/x)^x ~ 1/e                                  |

Consider the time complexity of the following code fragment:
```java
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
    for (int k = 1; k < n; k = k * 2)
      if (a[i] + a[j] >= a[k]) sum++;
```
The complexity of this algorithm is `~ 3/2 n^2 lg n`. Not all triple loops have cubic running times. For a given value of *i* and *j*, the *k*-loop requires only *3 lg n* array access: the body is executed *lg n* times and each time involves 3 array accesses. As in 2-SUM and 3-SUM, the number of times the *k*-loop is executed is *nC2 ~ 1/2 n^2*.

### Designing Faster Algorithms

#### Binary Search
Algorithms can be designed for efficiency. Consider searching an array for a particular key. A naive solution would require `n` array accesses. However, the following implementation of the binary search algorithm can guarantee `O(lg n)` performance.

```js
/*
 * BINARY SEARCH
 *
 * Given a sorted array and a key, find index of the key in the array
 */

const binarySearch = (sortedArray, key) => {
  let low = 0;
  let high = sortedArray.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

    if (sortedArray[mid] === key) {
      return mid; // Found the index of the key
    } else if (key > sortedArray[mid]) {
      low = mid + 1; // Go right
    } else if (key < sortedArray[mid]) {
      high = mid - 1; // Go left
    }
  }

  return -1; // Key not found
};

console.log(binarySearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 6)); // 5
console.log(binarySearch([38, 88, 199, 512, 600], 4)); // -1

```

#### Two Sum

Problem: Determine the number of *pairs* of integers in an input file that sums to 0. Assume that the integers are distinct. This is easily solved in quadratic time using a nested `for` loop that examines all pairs. However, mergesort and binary search can serve as a basis for a *linearithmic* solution.  

Algorithm: An entry `a[i]` is one of a pair that sums to 0 if and only if the value `-a[i]` is in the array (and `a[i]` is not zero). To solve the problem, we sort the array (to enable binary search) and then, for every entry `a[i]` in the array, do a binary search for `-a[i]`. If the result is an index `j` with `j > i`, we increment the count.

```js
/*
 * TWO SUM
 *
 * Find the number of pairs of integers in an input file that sum to 0. Assume
 * that the integers are distinct. Solve the problem with O(n log n) complexity
 */

const fs = require('fs');

const binarySearch = (sortedArray, key) => {
  let low = 0;
  let high = sortedArray.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

    if (sortedArray[mid] === key) {
      return mid; // Found the index of the key
    } else if (key > sortedArray[mid]) {
      low = mid + 1; // Go right
    } else if (key < sortedArray[mid]) {
      high = mid - 1; // Go left
    }
  }

  return -1; // Key not found
};

const twoSum = (arr) => {
  /*
   * Here we use JavaScript's native sort method, which is implemented using
   * QuickSort. However, we could also use MergeSort to guarantee O(n log n)
   * worst case time complexity.
   */
  arr = arr.sort((a, b) => {
    return a - b;
  });

  /*
   * Attempt to find the negative of the current element in the array using
   * binary search. Only increment count if index of current element greater
   * than index of found element to prevent double incrementation of count.
   */
  return arr.reduce((p, c, i) => {
    let result = binarySearch(arr, -c);
    return p += result >= 0 && i > result ? 1 : 0;
  }, 0);
};

let input = [];

fs.readFile('../../input/analysis-of-algorithms/4Kints.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
  data.split('\n').forEach((int) => {
    input.push(Number(int));
  });

  console.log(twoSum(input)); // 3
});

```

#### Three Sum

We can apply the same idea and extend the solution to solving `threeSum`. A pair `a[i]` and `a[j]` is part of a triple that sums to 0 if and only if the value `-(a[i] + a[j])` is in the array (and not `a[i]` or `a[j]`. The code below sorts the array, then does *N(N - 1) / 2* binary searches that each take time proportional to *log N*, for a total running time proportional to *N^2 log N*.

```js
/*
 * THREE SUM
 *
 * Find the number of triples of integers in an input file that sum to 0.
 * Assume that the integers are distinct. Solve the problem with O(n^2 log n)
 * time complexity.
 */

const fs = require('fs');

const binarySearch = (sortedArray, key) => {
  let low = 0;
  let high = sortedArray.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

    if (sortedArray[mid] === key) {
      return mid; // Found the index of the key
    } else if (key > sortedArray[mid]) {
      low = mid + 1; // Go right
    } else if (key < sortedArray[mid]) {
      high = mid - 1; // Go left
    }
  }

  return -1; // Key not found
};

const threeSum = (arr) => {
  /*
   * Here we use JavaScript's native sort method, which is implemented using
   * QuickSort. However, we could also use MergeSort to guarantee O(n log n)
   * worst case time complexity.
   */
  arr = arr.sort((a, b) => {
    return a - b;
  });

  /*
   * Attempt to find the negative of the current element in the array using
   * binary search. Only increment count if index of current element greater
   * than index of found element to prevent double incrementation of count.
   */
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 2; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length - 1; j++) {
      let result = binarySearch(arr, -(arr[i] + arr[j]));
      if (result >= 0 && result > j) { count++; }
    }
  }

  return count;
};

let input = [];

fs.readFile('../../input/analysis-of-algorithms/4Kints.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
  data.split('\n').forEach((int) => {
    if (int !== '') { input.push(Number(int)); }
  });

  console.log(threeSum(input)); // 3
});
